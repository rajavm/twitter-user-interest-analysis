"6","That's a wrap for this week's chat. Thanks to all who submitted questions and sorry to those @daltondeldon wasn’t able to get to. #AskFFL","sports"
"7","Always go QB when you can. Give me McCown. He's been surprisingly competent and Balt secondary struggling. #AskFFL https://t.co/w6CiQJR6kh","sports"
"8","He's been so frustrating, but I say yes, despite SD's struggles to run block. Gordon most 20+ yard carries in NFL. https://t.co/RrnUGPSCiz","sports"
"9","No. I'm not high on Stewart at all but K. Williams looks out this week and Julio is a top-5 overall asset. #AskFFL https://t.co/zqD6HhX17H","sports"
"10","I'm a big Lewis fan, but he's the odd man out here. Try to make a trade taking advantage of such RB depth. https://t.co/QYi9vkh2j1","sports"
"11","Feel free to drop Victor Cruz in all formats. #AskFFL https://t.co/H0PACMSM3r","sports"
"12","Go with Taylor. Still tough to trust Vick right now, and San Diego has been tough on QBs. #AskFFL https://t.co/m84bEIQoKH","sports"
"13","Good question. I'd go with Duke Johnson. He should be plenty busy Sunday as a receiver out of the backfield. #AskFFL https://t.co/GOx2hpESwH","sports"
"14","I like Maclin, but have to go Sanders here. #AskFFL https://t.co/p4R1HSYEWi","sports"
"15","All have their fleas, but give me Winston here. #AskFFL https://t.co/PurvWp4tZr","sports"
"16","I'd go with Randle. Niners secondary really struggling. https://t.co/dwpoN2dtMl","sports"
"17","I'd do it. Not too concerned about having players from same team, especially when they are on Green Bay. #AskFFL https://t.co/rbMZwZbLh1","sports"
"18","Yes, that's why he's especially hard to trust this week. #AskFFL https://t.co/vWPX5CB5Ie","sports"
"19","I like your ruthless style. I'd grab Bradford.  https://t.co/WBh4LHmDRw","sports"
"20","He's an interesting sleeper for sure for those in deep leagues dealing with injuries/byes. https://t.co/UkpvcoWTWA","sports"
"21","Whoever gets you a better return in a deal. #AskFFL https://t.co/TJGTVkqley","sports"
"22","Daniels for this week. Raiders allowing by far most fantasy points to opposing tight ends.  https://t.co/OmAPMgDuOJ","sports"
"23","@hogfanatic1992 Would go Chris Johnson.","sports"
"24","Kendall Wright and Todd Gurley. Treat Gurley as a top-10 fantasy RB (at minimum) over the rest of the season. https://t.co/f4aqkLuqeT","sports"
"25","@Vansavage_chris @CliffDressler That's a good point. A lot of it has been receiving yards by RBs, something Morris doesn't do.","sports"
"26","Mariota. He's a borderline QB1 moving forward.  https://t.co/y2SY1Tg2cN","sports"
"27","I'd certainly trust him more than Stewart that's for sure. Sneaky good matchup for Morris so long it's not a blowout https://t.co/nRfmOf8CwQ","sports"
"28","That's a bold statement. https://t.co/qbE3Jrl6pG","sports"
"29","I'm going to say this week. https://t.co/yuMWYqA1Qt","sports"
"30","Pick up Kelce and start him every week.  https://t.co/ufHdGn26OT","sports"
"31","Give me Cutler. KC has actually allowed most fantasy points to opposing QBs this season. #AskFFL https://t.co/BKR6jyLANd","sports"
"32","Forte, with PPR being the difference. #AskFFL https://t.co/cinDvmuhAL","sports"
"33","Texans D for sure. At home on a short week against a sick Hasselbeck. Yes please. #AskFFL https://t.co/p9o2sGfHlx","sports"
"34","All strong options, but I can't see sitting Fitzgerald at this point. #AskFFL https://t.co/oN0uvyALak","sports"
"35","Have to love Daniels' matchup against Oak, who's been the worst against TEs. But I'm still going Kelce over him. https://t.co/ndzZwm0HDd","sports"
"36","Like both of them this week but give me the Giants D. #AskFFL https://t.co/sL428pMgWn","sports"
"37","Definitely do that deal. Foster could easily be a top-5 RB over the rest of the season. Rivers/Dalton a wash #AskFFL https://t.co/oDblBWx3FV","sports"
"38","Keep Calvin Johnson. His schedule has been brutal and it eases up soon. Still been a target monster.  https://t.co/AcKd3XgkuE","sports"
"39","It's possible but the far safer bet is that Denver remains a committee for the foreseeable future. #AskFFL https://t.co/doOMaAErdB","sports"
"40","I still like Moncrief as a WR2 this week but I'd go with James Jones over him.  https://t.co/D0yHvBe8Dp","sports"
"41","Not totally crazy, but I'd stick with Green.  https://t.co/lesKW7k0lU","sports"
"42","I would've said Gurley even if Luck were playing.  https://t.co/lvJT6jJCUd","sports"
"43","I prefer the Thomas side. Who knows with Lynch's injury and Murray has more upside than Cooks at this point. #AskFFL https://t.co/bYOWfxro3M","sports"
"44","Even in a tough matchup, have to go Cooper over the rest of that group...Then it gets real close. I'll say Hankerson https://t.co/2BhwnpJIlp","sports"
"45","Fleener. At least he's not coming off an injury. #AskFFL https://t.co/WM1IIrMyd3","sports"
"46","That's a fair trade with RB being so thin, but PPR sways it for me, so I'd do it. Calvin should be much better. https://t.co/0xEnpo6fCj","sports"
"47","I'm still going with Moncrief in this case. Would need a better alternative to switch, even with no Luck. https://t.co/XfCZT03JMK","sports"
"48","I'd definitely be stashing C. Michael. https://t.co/UT1Yv1ntbd","sports"
"49","I'd go with Matt Jones. Falcons allowing most fantasy points to opposing RBs this season. https://t.co/ZxrqUA7Jvd","sports"
"50","Make a trade! I have all three as top-7 running back options this week. https://t.co/HYsFbv5HyT","sports"
"51","Go with the Bradford/Matthews combo. Love their matchup this week. Saints allowing 9.8 YPA w 7:0 TD:INT ratio. https://t.co/s917KjijHO","sports"
"52","Terrible matchup and 49ers have been brutal, but I'm still going Hyde over a D. Carrier type alternative. #AskFFL https://t.co/M21cSTtHYI","sports"
"53","I'm still rolling with Hilton over those other options, but obviously Luck's absence is a concern. https://t.co/kGL6aqqCr7","sports"
"54","Indy should theoretically rely more on Gore with Luck out but I'm going with D. Lewis. Patriots should score a lot. https://t.co/3huPzQfRPn","sports"

"107","Has to be Ingram until Hill reenters Circle of Trust.  https://t.co/BofGzfyoWY","sports"
"108","@santnic7 I beg you to play Karlos. I'd rank Ingram second.","sports"
"109","I'm only playing Brees if I really don't like the other option. In this case, I really like Palmer.  https://t.co/tcE2iLAb1k","sports"
"110","@Brandon_Rei Palmer's been more consistent.","sports"
"111","@DirectRays So ugly. I lean Alfred.","sports"
"112","@Kyle2hig I'll give Cooks one more week.","sports"

"119","@wfdelong Palmer still has a better floor.","sports"
"120","@JoeMarthaler I'd play Hill, expect a full game.","sports"
"121","Trade a QB down the road! I have them as ranking neighbors. Slightly prefer Dalton given KC defense shape.  https://t.co/AIuCs58hYR","sports"
"122","@joey_4215 I like Moncrief a little more, probably has more rep experience with Hasselbeck.","sports"
"123","I'd make that move in any league, zero hesitation. MT @josiahsp Drop Roddy for Ty Montgomery? #AskFFL","sports"
"124","@jamiewatson77 Hurns is more consistent week-to-week.","sports"
"125","Moncrief. Get a full game. Hasselbeck isn't the end of the world.  https://t.co/y9KV5LZzNV","sports"
"126","@grice_jason Maclin and Gore for me. But I do think Hill will be fine in the long run.","sports"
"127","@See_Eye39 I'd gamble on Morris, actually. But I know, it's a mess.","sports"
"128","@Brenden4685 Hilton upside, Crabtree floor. I'd probably play Hilton.","sports"
"129","Hill for me. And I would trade for them in seasonal. I expect both to eventually come back nicely. #AskFFL https://t.co/t3WUbomMI9","sports"
"130","Reading tea leaves, I suspect the Colts knew all week Luck would not go. Hasselbeck will be ready. Not a terrible backup.","sports"
"131","Moncrief. Hasselbeck is a backup, but he's not horrible. And they've had reps.  https://t.co/gT4q0lP8Tj","sports"
"132","@JustNMS Yikes, a mess. I don't expect either to get a ton of work. I would gamble Foster. Wish I had a strong lean!","sports"
"133","Cooks. At least you get a full game.  https://t.co/yR2j31Ezlk","sports"
"134","Lean Duke. I am not playing Spiller until I see it. At least Johnson only has one guy to beat.  https://t.co/s65ncccb5I","sports"
"135","Sadness is having zero Karlos Williams shares on my seasonal teams. DFS must-start, and I rarely speak in absolutes.","sports"
"136","Tate's a tier higher, maybe two tiers higher. I know it's a messy draw, but don't get too cute.  https://t.co/iZUnymmG1E","sports"
"137","Great one. I want to ride with Carr, Murray, Cooper, even Crabtree. I believe. And I believe in CHI's lousy defense. https://t.co/76wMMWKwTG","sports"
"138","@nelsond0312 I'd wait for Lynch if you have a pivot in the MNF game. If not, Mathews.","sports"
"139","@steelers3012 Cutler, but don't watch. Rake the leaves.","sports"
"140","@PleveJuan Dunbar easy in PPR. Standard, I still lean with Lance.","sports"
"141","James Jones for me. Clicking with his HOF QB, and no one knows what to expect from Murray.  https://t.co/NR4yjsLXXG","sports"
"142","@Hmkhitar Impossible to answer without some context. In deeper, I gambled on Michael and Zenner.","sports"
"143","Palmer's floor is so much higher these days. And the Vikings are not an easy draw.  https://t.co/xM3PyaT07m","sports"
"144","Yes. I'd gamble there.  https://t.co/6bWKEw6Z7A","sports"
"145","@juliotinkyouare I rank Moncrief in the WR 25-30 range. Good, not great, play.","sports"
"146","@Saucier_MSU Good options. I'd play Evans and Cooks, but no wrong plays here.","sports"
"147","Chris Johnson, even in crowded backfield. Stewart has let me down too many times.  https://t.co/xA4aRgyHlG","sports"
"148","@jimmyparsons11 I have Robinson ranked a tier earlier. They can move him away from Davis, I'm figuring, at least some of time.","sports"
"149","@sarbarnup13 I have to give Hill one more shot. I know it's been ugly, but he's still a major talent.","sports"
"150","Guessing Hasselbeck and Moncrief have the most practice history.  https://t.co/cSpYd9oqD3","sports"

"177","Assuming it's not PPR, I'd go with Mathews, who has a better chance to score. Dunbar easy call if PPR though. https://t.co/GQJKUQFq9d","sports"
"178","Weeden is a sneaky play this week in 2QB formats, but if he's active, I'm still playing Brees over him. #AskFFL https://t.co/zXMIGAO2Dv","sports"
"179","Sadly, if you need a WR for this week, yes. I was wrong about Adams, who looks droppable at this point.  https://t.co/joudeleQtH","sports"

"219","@kream1906 Shorts by default.","sports"
"220","@GorhamChandler Crow has easier path to touches.","sports"
"221","@Gehringk Jones for the Rodgers tailwind.","sports"
"222","@chefsasa @YahooNoise Martin sure seems healthier.","sports"
"223","@herbivore23 Both are dart throws. I'd go Hankerson first.","sports"
"224","Gore, as I expect the Colts to rebound in a lighter spot.  https://t.co/QTmd0wfX8V","sports"
"225","Allen has a much more proven QB, and should see more targets.  https://t.co/TTEdA3tjRh","sports"
"226","@D_Adams86 Powell is healthier. I have to lean there.","sports"
"227","@CalebStrack Miller. Benjamin is a fun player, but long touchdowns are so fluky and random.","sports"

"230","@wesquire440 Adams, though it's risky, he's dinged up.","sports"
"231","@rosssportsautos Murray has shown more the first two weeks. Denver OL should get fixed, but I won't assume it's overnight.","sports"

"241","@Stephenweisman Hate to sit a Packer WR at home, but Adams is dinged and inconsistent, so I dial up Jackson.","sports"
"242","Landry is a safer floor guy, so consistent. Lions using three backs, annoying us.  https://t.co/Ls0v0AwKgq","sports"
"243","Fleener for me. Worried about Chicago getting annihilated.  https://t.co/EOT41w1qYQ","sports"
