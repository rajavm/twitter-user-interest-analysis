"753","@mikelcal So far we’ve detected perchlorates, but there could be other minerals present.","technology"
"754","@SkylarMile All we can see from orbit is what’s on the surface of Mars, and we see evidence of flowing water.","technology"
"755","@brandonbolaa The brine slopes were seen in 2010, but the spectral detection of molecular water was a few months ago.","technology"
"756","@Latienie Not yet, but our InSight mission launches soon &amp; will drill down 5 meters to see how planets evolve: ","technology"
"757","@astanzo Yes, we could use this technique on other planetary bodies to find minerals including water.","technology"
"758","@robmantic1 We are detecting salt crystals with molecular water in them, which leads us to believe that the water would not be pure.","technology"

"760","Still have questions about our #MarsAnnouncement? Join our Reddit AMA @ 2pm ET to get answers ","technology"
"761","@saragreen2013 We've found iron, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen on Mars. Where water interacts with rocks, there is more diversity of mineral.","technology"
"762","@swilson191 Could be, but further investigation is needed to determine where the water is coming from. Updates here: ","technology"
"763","@themurphmaster There is some oxygen on Mars, but it is a very small concentration compared to the CO2. There wouldn’t be enough to breath.","technology"
"764","@tomerz073 We took images of the dark features and corrected the images pixel by pixel to detect hydration features: ","technology"
"765","@ThQueen_Rihanna We want to try to narrow down where the water came from, and we'll also look for similar areas on Mars.","technology"
"766","@Kenfohh We don’t know for sure because we don't know how deep the water goes. But we do have some ways to estimate.","technology"

"768","@eleni_nasa Not necessarily on the Mars 2020 rover, but we do plan to continue to study the water on Mars.","technology"
"769","@ShanilSchool At some point in the past, there was a lot of water on Mars. We believe some is still below the surface.","technology"
"770","@SamanthaJoint The great thing is that it’s water near the equator where it’s slightly warmer than the poles.","technology"
"771","@chethanIN It depends on how salty it is. We just don’t know yet. It would likely need to be purified.","technology"
"772","@Lganme We need to find out where the water comes from and get closer imaging of the dark streaks.","technology"
"773","@Burnzy0909 Maybe. It all depends on how saturated with salt the water is. Life as we know it couldn't survive if too salty.","technology"

"776","@Meredith7morgan We haven’t seen rain, but we have seen snow. We do think a full water cycle existed billions of years ago.","technology"
"777","@thisisrachels We think the water does evaporate. Because of the salt, it happens must slower. The source of water is the big question.","technology"
"778","@KC_2020 We detected water. It's not circumstantial. We want to go and investigate, but there are no specific mission planned... yet.","technology"
"779","@dragonborn2112 There is water. The features we're seeing on Mars are indeed caused from water flow.","technology"
