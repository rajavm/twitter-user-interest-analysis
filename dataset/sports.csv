"3148","That's a wrap for this week's chat. Thanks to all who submitted questions and sorry to those @daltondeldon wasn’t able to get to. #AskFFL","sports"
"3149","Always go QB when you can. Give me McCown. He's been surprisingly competent and Balt secondary struggling. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3150","He's been so frustrating, but I say yes, despite SD's struggles to run block. Gordon most 20+ yard carries in NFL. ","sports"
"3151","No. I'm not high on Stewart at all but K. Williams looks out this week and Julio is a top-5 overall asset. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3152","I'm a big Lewis fan, but he's the odd man out here. Try to make a trade taking advantage of such RB depth. ","sports"
"3153","Feel free to drop Victor Cruz in all formats. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3154","Go with Taylor. Still tough to trust Vick right now, and San Diego has been tough on QBs. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3155","Good question. I'd go with Duke Johnson. He should be plenty busy Sunday as a receiver out of the backfield. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3156","I like Maclin, but have to go Sanders here. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3157","All have their fleas, but give me Winston here. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3158","I'd go with Randle. Niners secondary really struggling. ","sports"
"3159","I'd do it. Not too concerned about having players from same team, especially when they are on Green Bay. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3160","Yes, that's why he's especially hard to trust this week. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3161","I like your ruthless style. I'd grab Bradford.  ","sports"
"3162","He's an interesting sleeper for sure for those in deep leagues dealing with injuries/byes. ","sports"
"3163","Whoever gets you a better return in a deal. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3164","Daniels for this week. Raiders allowing by far most fantasy points to opposing tight ends.  ","sports"
"3165","@hogfanatic1992 Would go Chris Johnson.","sports"
"3166","Kendall Wright and Todd Gurley. Treat Gurley as a top-10 fantasy RB (at minimum) over the rest of the season. ","sports"
"3167","@Vansavage_chris @CliffDressler That's a good point. A lot of it has been receiving yards by RBs, something Morris doesn't do.","sports"
"3168","Mariota. He's a borderline QB1 moving forward.  ","sports"
"3169","I'd certainly trust him more than Stewart that's for sure. Sneaky good matchup for Morris so long it's not a blowout ","sports"
"3170","That's a bold statement. ","sports"
"3171","I'm going to say this week. ","sports"
"3172","Pick up Kelce and start him every week.  ","sports"
"3173","Give me Cutler. KC has actually allowed most fantasy points to opposing QBs this season. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3174","Forte, with PPR being the difference. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3175","Texans D for sure. At home on a short week against a sick Hasselbeck. Yes please. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3176","All strong options, but I can't see sitting Fitzgerald at this point. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3177","Have to love Daniels' matchup against Oak, who's been the worst against TEs. But I'm still going Kelce over him. ","sports"
"3178","Like both of them this week but give me the Giants D. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3179","Definitely do that deal. Foster could easily be a top-5 RB over the rest of the season. Rivers/Dalton a wash #AskFFL ","sports"
"3180","Keep Calvin Johnson. His schedule has been brutal and it eases up soon. Still been a target monster.  ","sports"
"3181","It's possible but the far safer bet is that Denver remains a committee for the foreseeable future. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3182","I still like Moncrief as a WR2 this week but I'd go with James Jones over him.  ","sports"
"3183","Not totally crazy, but I'd stick with Green.  ","sports"
"3184","I would've said Gurley even if Luck were playing.  ","sports"
"3185","I prefer the Thomas side. Who knows with Lynch's injury and Murray has more upside than Cooks at this point. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3186","Even in a tough matchup, have to go Cooper over the rest of that group...Then it gets real close. I'll say Hankerson ","sports"
"3187","Fleener. At least he's not coming off an injury. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3188","That's a fair trade with RB being so thin, but PPR sways it for me, so I'd do it. Calvin should be much better. ","sports"
"3189","I'm still going with Moncrief in this case. Would need a better alternative to switch, even with no Luck. ","sports"
"3190","I'd definitely be stashing C. Michael. ","sports"
"3191","I'd go with Matt Jones. Falcons allowing most fantasy points to opposing RBs this season. ","sports"
"3192","Make a trade! I have all three as top-7 running back options this week. ","sports"
"3193","Go with the Bradford/Matthews combo. Love their matchup this week. Saints allowing 9.8 YPA w 7:0 TD:INT ratio. ","sports"
"3194","Terrible matchup and 49ers have been brutal, but I'm still going Hyde over a D. Carrier type alternative. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3195","I'm still rolling with Hilton over those other options, but obviously Luck's absence is a concern. ","sports"
"3196","Indy should theoretically rely more on Gore with Luck out but I'm going with D. Lewis. Patriots should score a lot. ","sports"

"3240","I have no idea if Murray will play much. Hill should at least be first GL option. He's still a damn good back.  ","sports"
"3241","@elwinter I know it sounds weird, but I have to play Carr, stick with what's working.","sports"

"3248","Hyde. Have to give him the nod on floor.  ","sports"
"3249","Has to be Ingram until Hill reenters Circle of Trust.  ","sports"
"3250","@santnic7 I beg you to play Karlos. I'd rank Ingram second.","sports"
"3251","I'm only playing Brees if I really don't like the other option. In this case, I really like Palmer.  ","sports"
"3252","@Brandon_Rei Palmer's been more consistent.","sports"
"3253","@DirectRays So ugly. I lean Alfred.","sports"
"3254","@Kyle2hig I'll give Cooks one more week.","sports"

"3263","Trade a QB down the road! I have them as ranking neighbors. Slightly prefer Dalton given KC defense shape.  ","sports"
"3264","@joey_4215 I like Moncrief a little more, probably has more rep experience with Hasselbeck.","sports"

"3270","@Brenden4685 Hilton upside, Crabtree floor. I'd probably play Hilton.","sports"
"3271","Hill for me. And I would trade for them in seasonal. I expect both to eventually come back nicely. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3272","Reading tea leaves, I suspect the Colts knew all week Luck would not go. Hasselbeck will be ready. Not a terrible backup.","sports"
"3273","Moncrief. Hasselbeck is a backup, but he's not horrible. And they've had reps.  ","sports"
"3274","@JustNMS Yikes, a mess. I don't expect either to get a ton of work. I would gamble Foster. Wish I had a strong lean!","sports"

"3286","Yes. I'd gamble there.  ","sports"
"3287","@juliotinkyouare I rank Moncrief in the WR 25-30 range. Good, not great, play.","sports"
"3288","@Saucier_MSU Good options. I'd play Evans and Cooks, but no wrong plays here.","sports"
"3289","Chris Johnson, even in crowded backfield. Stewart has let me down too many times.  ","sports"

"3314","That's a wrap for this week's chat. Thanks to all who submitted questions and sorry to those we didn't get to. #AskFFL","sports"
"3315","Andrews should be stashed in all but really shallow leagues right now. Could emerge as lead back after bye. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3316","Reed because he is much safer bet to get more volume. ","sports"
"3317","Really talented but will take multiple injuries in ARI backfield for him to become reliable anytime soon. #AskFFL ","sports"

"3319","Assuming it's not PPR, I'd go with Mathews, who has a better chance to score. Dunbar easy call if PPR though. ","sports"
"3320","Weeden is a sneaky play this week in 2QB formats, but if he's active, I'm still playing Brees over him. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3321","Sadly, if you need a WR for this week, yes. I was wrong about Adams, who looks droppable at this point.  ","sports"
"3322","Fair offer, but I'd stand pat with Lacy/Hilton. Brown's value will take a hit while Ben is out. Lacy will be better. ","sports"
"3323","Assuming his arm is fine, which I am, I'd still roll with Luck. Colts should right the ship against Jax. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3324","He's been a huge disappointment but Im still going with Forsett over Abdullah right now. Latter's snaps inconsistent ","sports"
"3325","Unfortunately, I'd expect a full blown committee. It's a situation to avoid entirely (even if Stewart plays). ","sports"
"3326","Go Ryan until we see how healthy Brees is. It's not like he was lighting it up even before he got hurt either. ","sports"

"3329","Bennett. Raiders have allowed by far the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends this season. ","sports"
"3330","I know Hill has been a massive disappointment, but he's still extremely talented and was taken early for a reason. ","sports"
"3331","That's a tough one. Give me Stevie Johnson, who I expect to be more involved this week compared to last. ","sports"
"3332","I'm not sure there's a (non-QB) player in the league I'd play over Julio Jones at this point. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3333","I love Moncrief, and he's a bit more suited for Red Zone work, but I'm still ranking Hilton higher. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3334","Lacy and K. Williams, and I love Freeman too. I'd sit Smith among WRs. Make some trades!  ","sports"
"3335","Yeldon and J. Hill. Sub Dunbar for Yeldon if it's PPR. Stewart might not even play. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3336","Risky going with Jeffery coming off injury but I'd go with him. Tough to trust CJA right now. #AskFFL ","sports"
"3337","Carr over Brees. Who knows how healthy Brees' shoulder will be. Too much of an unknown. #AskFFL ","sports"
